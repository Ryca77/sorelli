				<p>Catherine Hancock</p>
				<p>I think it is fair to say that I am a ‘doer’… I very rarely sit still and always looking for the next thing to do.</p>
				<p>Coming from a very corporate sales background but taking the plunge 10 years ago to work for smaller businesses I feel I am a pretty rounded person now.</p>
				<p>As I have matured and tried to balance being a mother, wife and business person, I have realised that re-inventing yourself and adapting is all part of life.</p>
				<p>Recently a former employer said...</p>
				<p>“Catherine has a high sense of responsibility and accountability. She also achieved very good reviews from our customers and became very used to dealing with the high demands of both private and corporate customers. She has a good sense of urgency and tends to lead by example and is not at all afraid to muck in and when she sees some shortcomings is more than prepared to solve the situation herself.  She is well organised and has developed a logical approach to hospitality although that has not been her background. She is happy to tackle the unknown and is quite prepared to take on additional responsibility when required. She is very personable and a good team player.”</p>
				<p>I have a strong background in client relationship management, business development, CRM development and event management. Oh and my IT skills are pretty good too...</p>
				<p>I love solving problems and providing solutions, being creative but most of all I love things to be organised.</p>
				<p>Lucy Murphy</p>
				<p>I could never actually believe how lucky I was to be paid to do what I loved to do for 22 years. In fact it took me a long time to realise that so many people hated their jobs.</p>
				<p>Whilst I was an instructor and a manager in the health and fitness industry for 22 years it was always the customer experience that drove me. I wanted everyone to walk away from my classes or the clubs talking about us to their friends. It almost became an obsession to ensure that all staff had the same work ethic as me. I love to troubleshoot and see why something happened a particular way and how it can be improved. ‘A dog with a bone’ has been used on more than one occasion to describe me.</p>
				<p>So how does this help you? Well after years of seeing how the top health clubs deliver unique customer journeys, managing staff, selling memberships and working in world class events managing the marketing, PR, venue sourcing, health & safety, staff training, accommodation and travel for VIPS, hospitality, party planning hopefully I can help in some way.</p>
				<p>Since having my children it’s been important for me to work around them and have been fortunate to change course completely by working for a local company specialising in education solutions for schools. This has given me a totally different insight into a new sector and was able to develop a successful lead generating system at the same time as managing the CRM and supporting the Managing Director.</p>
